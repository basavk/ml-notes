* **NumPy‘s** array type augments the Python language with an efficient data structure useful for numerical work, e.g., manipulating matrices. NumPy also provides basic numerical routines, such as tools for finding eigenvectors.

* **SciPy** contains additional routines needed in scientific work: for example, routines for computing integrals numerically, solving differential equations, optimization, and sparse matrices.

* The **matplotlib** module produces high quality plots. With it you can turn your data or your models into figures for presentations or articles. No need to do the numerical work in one program, save the data, and plot it with another program.

* Using **IPython** makes interactive work easy. Data processing, exploration of numerical models, trying out operations on-the-fly allows to go quickly from an idea to a result. See the IPython site for many examples.

* There is a sizeable collection of both generic and application-specific numerical and scientific code, written using Python, NumPy and SciPy. Don’t reinvent the wheel, there may already be a pre-made solution for your problem. See Topical Software for a partial list.

* As **Python** is a popular general-purpose programming language, it has many advanced modules for building for example interactive applications (see e.g. wxPython and Traits) or web sites (see e.g. Django). Using SciPy with these is a quick way to build a fully-fledged scientific application.
